    <p>The code uses modern standards: C++17, CMake for builds, CUDA/Metal for GPU acceleration, OpenCV for image processing. The logic for hybrid compute (CPU/GPU upscaling, stitching) is current and efficient. Benchmarks are disabled on Windows due to MSVC runtime linking conflicts; otherwise, static MSVC runtime is used. No old standards; it's well-maintained and up-to-date.</p>
